              <p align="justify">I am Juan Agustin Ordoñez, people call me Justin. I was born from Naga City but I grew up in Metro Manila.  I live with my parents and with my only sibling. I took my elementary and high school at Don Bosco Manila and Don Bosco Technical College in Mandaluyong.
</p>
<p align="justify">I’ve been very active with school activities and extracurricular activities in elementary and high school. My favorite subject was math and I used to be a representative of our school in math conventions during my elementary days. I was once a plus-size kid who later then joined the basketball varsity team in high school. My body shaped better than ever before and with all the hard work I stepped up my game and joined the college basketball varsity team during my senior high school years. When I reached college, since there were no varsity programs offered by the school I focused on playing mobile games. Speaking of college, the first course which I should’ve been enrolled was BS in Marine Transportation which was chosen by my parents. The second course was my personal choice, BS in Multimedia Arts but I thought about the opportunities. That’s why I end up in BS in Information Technology which I also desire and find it wise.
</p><p align="justify">I expect in learning the basic fundamentals of UI/UX Design and Programming. I hope that this would be a fun and exciting experience and would be taught as creative as possible. I also expect that the subject wouldn’t be boring and it would have exciting projects and activities.

                <img src="images/angkas.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
				<p><b><center> Reasons why Angkas is my favorite app </b></center></p>
				<p align="justify">
				Angkas is a ride-hailing application like Grab and Uber. What I like about it 
				is that it beats the traffic in Metro Manila, means to say that I can go to my destination
				in no time. </p>
				<p align="justify">As a college student who lives far from my school. This application is a life-saver to me;
				whenever I need to rush myself to class I'll just pull-out my phone and book from a ride from Angkas.
				Furthermore, it is cheaper than any ride-hailing applications and they oftenly give more promo codes. It 
				came to the point that I don't have to pay a single cent. Angkas also prioritize safety, they make sure their customers
				would be safe by providing helmet, hair caps, face masks, safety procedures, and raincoats (when it's raining ofcourse). 
				The riders also were taken into serious training before they've become an official partners  of Angkas. </p>
				<p align="justify">
				So far, after numerous times of using this application, I haven't experienced any issues. When in fact, the riders
				were accomodating and friendly as of my experience, they'll talk to you anything under the sun, which really makes
				me comfortable. Lastly, I've also done multiple deliveries through this application and they are really reliable and 
				trustworthy people. I highly support and recommend Angkas!

				<h2 class="mb-3" id="A3">A3: 1000 Floor Elevator</h2>
				<img src="images/activity3.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
				<p align="justify" >
				If I were to design an elevator interface to a 1000 floor building. It would have 10 buttons (0 to 9), from their
				the users would have to input their desired floor number, after that the users would have to press the add button. 
				</p>
				<p align="justify" >
				They also have an option to re-enter their floor by pressing the x button. Furthermore, after pressing the add button 
				their desired floor will be shown at the screen, it will be added in the queue list. Witht this concept the users 
				would be able to reach their floor with no hassle in finding their floor from the traditional elevator button concept.

				<h3> Problem: </h3>
<p>•	Miscommunication of Manileños and Foreigners to native Filipinos or vice versa.</p>
<p>•	Difficulty to communicate with the native Filipino dialects when travelling in the Philippines.</p>
<p>•	Different varieties of Filipino dialects create gaps among Manileños and Foreigners.</p>

<h3>Needs:</h3>
<p>•	To communicate and understand one another</p>
<p>•	To share information accurately</p>
<p>•	To provide a tool that will bridge language gaps</p>
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<p>•	Creating application that enables Filipinos and Foreigners to translate their language to their desired native Filipino dialect and vice versa.</p>
